# Deployment

## Application

The GitHub `main` branch deploys automatically to the Vercel project `faith-in`. Production uses `faithin.co`; `www.faithin.co` redirects permanently to the apex domain.

The apex route is internally rewritten to `/faithin-app/index.html`, which is
the current Faith In interface. The legacy application remains available at
`/app` while the new interface is connected to the production data services.

Before publishing:

1. Run `npm run lint`.
2. Run `npm run typecheck`.
3. Run `npm test` and `npm run test:rules`.
4. Run `npm run build` and `npm audit --omit=dev`.
5. Review the staged diff for credentials and unrelated files.
6. Push to GitHub and verify the resulting Vercel deployment.

Required Vercel variables are listed in `.env.example`. `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`
is server-only and must never be prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.

## Firebase rules

The Firebase project is declared in `.firebaserc`. After authenticating the Firebase CLI, deploy rules with:

```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,firestore:indexes,storage
```

Follow the rollout in `docs/migrations/2026-08-15-public-profiles.md`. Review
changes in the Firebase Console and test with a non-administrator account
before enabling App Check enforcement.

## GitHub sign-in

GitHub uses Firebase Authentication, so no GitHub client secret belongs in
Vercel or browser code. Enable the GitHub provider in Firebase Authentication,
configure the callback URL Firebase displays in the GitHub OAuth app, ensure
`faithin.co` is an authorized Firebase domain, then set
`NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_AUTH_ENABLED=true` in the relevant Vercel environments.
Leave the flag false until the provider is configured.

## Firebase data backend (added August 2026)

The application originally ran on a WordPress PHP backend. When it became a
standalone Next.js app, `/api/compat` was left returning HTTP 501 for every
data action, which meant creating posts, loading the feed, commenting, liking
and editing a profile all failed silently for members.

`public/assets/js/faith-in-backend.js` now serves those actions directly from
Firebase. It installs a jQuery ajax transport that intercepts requests to
`cv_ajax.ajax_url`, reads the `action`, and fulfils it against Firebase Auth,
Cloud Firestore and Cloud Storage, returning the same `{ success, data }`
envelope the application already expected. No calling code changed.

### Required deployment step

**The Firestore rules must be deployed or posting will fail with a permission
error.** The previous rules locked every collection except `users`, so the
`posts` collection could not be written to at all.

```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,firestore:indexes,storage
```

Verify afterwards in the Firebase console under Firestore → Rules that the
`posts` block is present.

### What is implemented

| Area | Actions | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Auth | `cv_get_session`, `cv_firebase_sign_in`, `cv_logout` | Live — creates the Firestore profile on first sign-in |
| Feed | `cv_create_post`, `cv_get_posts`, `cv_update_post`, `cv_delete_post` | Live — text, images, video, blessings, visibility |
| Engagement | `cv_like_post`, `cv_create_post_comment`, `cv_share_post`, `cv_repost_post` | Live — one reaction per member, tap again to remove |
| Media | `cv_stage_post_media` | Live — uploads to Cloud Storage |
| Library | `cv_get_resources`, `cv_upload_resource`, `cv_delete_resource`, `cv_download_resource` | Live — with download counts |
| Prayer | `cv_get_prayers`, `cv_create_prayer`, `cv_update_prayer`, `cv_delete_prayer` | Live — including "I prayed for this" |
| Jobs | `cv_get_jobs`, `cv_create_job`, `cv_update_job`, `cv_delete_job` | Live |
| Members | `cv_find_users`, `cv_get_suggested_users` | Live — searches name, church, ministry, role, location |
| Following | `cv_social_follow_user`, `cv_social_unfollow_user`, `cv_social_get_followers`, `cv_social_get_following` | Live |
| Profile | `cv_update_profile`, `cv_update_user_settings` | Live — name, photo, theme, language |
| Verification | `cv_get_verification_status`, `cv_request_verification` | Live — requests are stored; granting a badge is a manual admin step |
| Bible | `cv_bible_save_notes`, `cv_bible_get_notes`, `cv_bible_save_typing_score` | Live |
| Bible text | `cv_bible_get_versions`, `cv_bible_get_verses`, `cv_bible_dictionary`, `cv_bible_get_quotes`, `cv_bible_get_media` | Live — public translations work immediately; Khmer Old Version 1954 uses the official YouVersion Platform connection |
| Messaging | REST endpoints under `rest_root` | Not implemented — needs a real-time backend |
| AI images | `cv_bible_ai_image` | Not implemented — needs an image generation provider |

Anything not implemented returns a plain-language "still being built" message
rather than an error. Each remaining action is a small addition to the
`actions` map in `faith-in-backend.js`.

### Khmer Old Version 1954

The Khmer Old Version 1954 text is copyrighted by the Bible Society in
Cambodia/United Bible Societies. It must not be committed to this repository.
Create an app in the YouVersion Platform portal, accept the publisher license
for Bible version `1270`, and configure the server-only `YVP_APP_KEY` variable
in Vercel. `YVP_KHMER_BIBLE_ID` defaults to `1270` and normally does not need to
be changed. The `/api/bible/chapter` route keeps the key private and returns the
copyright attribution required by the version license.

### Tests

```bash
npm test
```

`npm test` runs `tests/backend.test.mjs`, which loads the backend with a fake jQuery and
fake Firebase and exercises the transport end to end — session creation, text
and media posts, the 25MB limit, feed shaping, reactions, comments, deletion,
and pass-through of non-application requests.

`npm run test:rules` starts the local Firestore emulator and verifies that
account documents are private, public profiles exclude email, private posts are
owner-only, authorship cannot be reassigned, engagement fields cannot be
arbitrarily overwritten, and unsafe outbound links are rejected. It never
connects to the production database.

### Limits

- 25MB per file, 10 files per post — kept in step with `storage.rules`.
- New uploads go to `faith-in/{uid}/` in Vercel Blob after server-side token and
  file-signature validation. Existing Firebase Storage files and paths remain
  unchanged.
